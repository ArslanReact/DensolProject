                <ol>
                    <li>Intercel's goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. The customer is entitled to a

                        also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to
                        a major failure.</li>
                    <li>In addition to the customer's rights under the Australian Consumer Law, for the period of 12 months from the date of supply of the

                    <li>The customer agrees that the provisions of clause 4,1 create a security interest (including, where applicable, a Purchase Money
                        Security Interest as it is defined in the Personal Properties Security Act 2009 (Cth) (“PPSA”)) in goods (and their proceeds) supplied
                        by Intercel to the customer. </li>
                    <li>The customer acknowledges and agreesthat Intercel may register each security interest granted by the customer under these terms
                        and conditions on the Commonwealth personal property securities register, and do all things necessary to ensure that Intercel
                        acquire a perfected security interest in the goods supplied by Intercel under the PPSA.</li>

            <li><strong>Prices</strong><br>

                <ol>
                    <li>Intercel uses its own preferred carrier unless an alternative carrier is specifically requested by the customer. Please note that this
                        may result in delays in shipment.</li>
                    <li>Responsibility for the goods passes to the customer once the goods have been passed to the courier. Insurance liability is therefore

                        accepted by Intercel will incur a restocking fee the greater of $75 or 5% of invoice value plus freight costs. Returned goods will only
                        be accepted if returned in original saleable condition.</li>

                your reasonable control (“Force Majeure Event”) prevents or delays us or you from performing any obligation under the agreement
